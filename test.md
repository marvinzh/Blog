        firstly, I will talk with him, figure out if it’s because any kind of problem he met or he just do not have motivation. 
        
        I will try to help him in those fields that I know and help him to find a easier way to solve the problem, or I will find some other who is professional in his problem.
        
        lastly, I will reflect on myself, think about why such things happen, and figure out how to make things better next time.

        Python, (Java)
        
        recent work, called "tinytorch", a deep learning framework to mimic the pytorch
        it is still a work in progress, i have almost finish the prototype development.
        without GPU support.
        
        - java is static, python is dynamic
        - java need to compile, python is run by interpret
        - java is bascally developed for large scale applicatin, while python is more suitable for prototype development.

      Microsoft is the world's bigest IT company, 
      
      comparing simply doing research at labotoary, I perfer transfer the research into real product or service.
